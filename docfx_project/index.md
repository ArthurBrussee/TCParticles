## FAQ

Q: Does TC Particles work on mobile?
* A: While generally not advisable, the latest iPads and iPhones with Metal should work. Additionally android devices supporting the latest openGL ES 3.0 spec can run TC Particles. This is not a generally well supported use case though.

Q: Does TC Particles come with source?
* A: Full source is included!

Q: Does TC Particles support mesh colliders?
* A: No, only primitive colldiers are supported. However, a more compelx range of primitives than in PhysX is supported, so it is easier to build complex shapes out of primitives.

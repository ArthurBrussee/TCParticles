Thank you for purchasing TC Particles! I hope you are just as enthused by the possibilities of GPU particles as I am!

IMPORTANT: If you upgraded from a version before 1.4 and had a DLL version you WILL lose your references. To fix:

1. Delete all files in the implementation folder.
2. Extract the TC Particles DLL, and place the DLL in the implementation folder

OR

Open the scenes / prefabs with lost references, and drag the appropriate component on there

Release notes:

1.5

-Moved the Editor folder now that it can be under the TC Particles root to make package managment easier


-Improved force priority sorting to sort by actual force not just distance
-Improved performance of priority sorting when a system is linked to more forces/colliders than max forces/colliders
-Reduced garbage generated in a bunch of scenarios
-Increased performance for multi pass materials


-Fixed tail UV globally being set to the tail UV of the very first TC Particle system created
    NOTE: The value has been globally reset to the default 0.5 since it wasn't doing anything
-Fixed all compile warnings
-Fixed missing gizmos and wireframes
-Fixed some inconsitencies between constant / non constant forces
-Fixed velocity over lifetime not affecting velocity effects like stretch or color over velocity
-Fixed some issues with in editor visualisation
-Fixed some nullrefs on starting / stopping
-Fixed Vortex inward force framerate dependance issue
-Fixed playback speed + "sticky" particle issues 
-Fixed issue where sometimes colliders/forces were picked up only after ~a second 


1.4.1

-Optimized instantiating systems ~4-5x. Generates ~20x less garbage now
-Optimized update of systems by being more careful about what properties to bind when
-Added a MaxSpeed property to particles


-Fixed an issue where enabling / disabling a system would still interpolate the positions.
-Fixed extension templates, removed explicit bind call, handled when dispatched now
-Cleaned up some code

NOTE: You need to update your extensions, as the system parameters have changed

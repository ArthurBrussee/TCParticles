Thank you for purchasing TC Particles! I hope you are just as enthused by the possibilities of GPU particles as I am!

For more info, support, documentation and the API reference, please refer to https://arthurbrussee.github.io/TCParticlesDocumentation/

IMPORTANT: If you upgraded from a version before 1.4 and had a DLL version you WILL lose your references. To fix:

1. Delete all files in the implementation folder.
2. Extract the TC Particles DLL, and place the DLL in the implementation folder
OR
Open the scenes / prefabs with lost references, and drag the appropriate component on there
